Interval exchange transformation
================================

This module provides an implementation of "Boshernitzan algorithm" using
interval exchange transformation. The aim is to compute the decomposition
of a given measured foliation into its periodic and minimal components. The
delicate part is of course to certify that a given component is minimal and
this is where the Boshernitzan's algorithm comes into play.

With the iet version we do not do the full decomposition but rather on
one side the union of minimal components and on the other side the
periodic components. Separating minimal components is not easily achieved
with Rauzy induction.

If we do implement saddle connection search via flipping, we might want
to implement the decomposition by flipping. In that case we can separate
the minimal components and recover the full decomposition.
